  <h1>Heading</h1>
  <p>  I wanted to buy #OnePlus 8 pro but I stopped as it's made in China.<br>

So I changed my opinion and searched for #iphone11 sadly 80% of iPhones are made in #China<br>

I decided to open #flipkart to search for other mobiles but Flipkart is funded by #Chinese_venture_capital. I was extremely disappointed and thought of eating some delicious food opened #Zomato #Swiggy irony is that both are funded by chinese firms.<br>

I decided to order some snacks from #Big_Basket, is also funded by china. I was vexed went to restaurant. But to go there, I booked #ola and cancelled because China funded ola too.
<br>
I wanted to compromise for food but Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) driver was accepting ride only if pay through Paytm is also China funded.<br>
I was fed up and wanted to open my laptop to learn something.That's #Lenovo, but made in China apologies again. I survived with the screening and opened #BYJU'S to learn oops! again is funded by China.<br>

After seeing all this I got severe headache and thought of popping a pill (paracetamol) omg! China is there too.<br>

Finally I died of severe headache. My friends posted RIP from their #Chinamobiles.<br>
